#A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called. You can pass data, known as paraments, into a function. A function can return data as a result.
#Example: def my_function(FirstName, LastName):
#           print(FirstName + "" + LastName)
#         my_function ("Grevy", "Marcelin")

def my_function(FirstName, LastName):
      print(FirstName + "" + LastName)
my_function ("Grevy", "Marcelin")

# To call the function you have to break out of the print statement (indent)

#def check_age(age):
#  if age < 18:
#    print('oops not an adult')
#  else:
#    print('hooray I am an adult')  

#check_age(18)
#check_age(17)
